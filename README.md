# Reference
**PyCalc** is a customizable elementary graphical user interface based calculator designed with module Tkinter, the standard Python interface. The code standardly written using classes, uses Tk, a Tcl package implemented in C that adds custom commands to create and manipulate GUI widgets. Each Tk object embeds its own Tcl interpreter instance with Tk loaded into it. Tk uses Tclâ€™s event queue to generate and process GUI events. A quite handy project for beginner python developers to begin with GUI projects.
